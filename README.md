# Advent of Code 2022

Let's learn more programming languages! The goal of this year is to learn few languages that:

- have been somewhat influencial on programming today
- have interesting or unique or uncommon paradigm or features
- have not been used in my attempt at [Advent of Code 2021](https://github.com/RobertBendun/advent-of-code-2021)
- I don't use everyday (this excludes C, C++, JavaScript, Haskell, Python etc.)

## Journal

### Day 1 - Common Lisp

Main reason for using this language is to learn loop macro which is _wild_ - a whole EDSL for expressing iteration.
And from first usage it seems quite nice. Whish more functional programming language have EDSLs like that.

Used [sbcl](https://www.sbcl.org/) implementation and documentation from [Lisp Cookbook](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/).

### Day 2 - R

Encoding solution as linear algebra equations is easy - the hard part is handling input and my solution definitely can be improved by some R magic that is unknown to me.

### Day 3 - Scala

It's astonishing how many of languages that I tried for this day ware hard to launch. But anyway, Scala shines in comparison both for batteries included approach and ease of use.

### Day 4 - AWK

It's to easy! AWK is glorious with it's simplicity.
